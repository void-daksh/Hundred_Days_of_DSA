/*You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.*/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>

int maxProfit(int prices[], int n) {
    int minPrice = INT_MAX;
    int maxProfit = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (prices[i] < minPrice) {
            minPrice = prices[i];
        } else if (prices[i] - minPrice > maxProfit) {
            maxProfit = prices[i] - minPrice;
        }
    }
    return maxProfit;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);

    int prices[n];  
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &prices[i]);
    }

    int result = maxProfit(prices, n);
    printf("%d\n", result);

    return 0;
}
